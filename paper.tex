% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

% Questions regarding SIGS should be sent to

% Questions/suggestions regarding the guidelines, .tex and .cls files, etc. to

% For tracking purposes - this is V3.1SP - APRIL 2009

\begin{abstract}
A recommendation system tracks previous activities of a set of users, and analyses their purchasing, browsing or rating patterns to predict and recommend a set of items to each user which are potentially of interest to him. This paper provides an overview of the rapidly emerging field of recommender systems. We discuss the 3 main categories of recommendation systems: collaborative, content-based and hybrid systems. The paper also analyses standard algorithms for item-based recommendations, wherein recommendations are provided based on past activities of the user himself, and user-based recommendations, which computes similarities and relationships between different users and exploits these relationships to come up with recommendations. Further, we explore the state-of-the-art and variations to standard techniques employed in the current generation of recommender systems. Finally, we analyse their limitations and provide directions for future work.
